    <h1>Manifesto for Agile Software Development</h1>
    <p>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</p>
    <p>Working software over comprehensive documentation</p>
    <p>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</p>
    <p>Responding to change over following a plan</p>
    <h1>Principles behind the Agile Manifesto</h1>
    <p>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</p>
    <p>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.</p>
    <p>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</p>
    <p>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</p>
    <p>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</p>
    <p>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</p>
    <p>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</p>
    <p>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</p>
    <p>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</p>
    <p>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.</p>
    <p>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</p>
    <p>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</p>
